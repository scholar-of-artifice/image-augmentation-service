## 🐍 Where can I find the Python programming language?

site: https://www.python.org

There are installation instructions on this website. You will find releases for `Windows`, `MacOS` and `Linux`.

### For `Linux` users
Many Linux distributions have Python already installed.

## Is there a video tutorial?
I recommend Corey Schafer's video on getting started.
